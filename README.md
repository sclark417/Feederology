# Feedeorology

## Description 

With this app we are combining both weather and food to create a user experience based on the mood of the weather. We worked as a team of developers to combine the usage of OpenWeatherMap API and Edemam API to create a site that will help the user answer the age old question of "what is for dinner?"

There were many challenges while making this site, most notably getting the two APIs to work together and not over using our API keys. In addition there was a steep learning curve that came from the usage of multiple branches on gitHub, but in the ned we over came those challenges. 

Our application is deployed and ready for users at the following link.

I have also included the link to our proposal that includes a demonstration and a deeper look into the sites technology and purpose.

## Installation

There is no installation necessary for this application it is already up and running. 

## Usage

The usage of this application is very straight forward. The user enters the city in which they live and they will both be prompted with the weather and weather appropriate  foods, for example if it is a miserably cold day you might get soup recipes or Hot Rum Toties. 

If the user has health or food restrictions then they can choose to refine their search with or selectors on right under the search bar. This way they can more easily find a fitting recipe for them, right off the bat.
