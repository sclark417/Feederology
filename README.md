CONCEPT:
What do you want for dinner tonight? The question that all couples, parents, and individuals dread. With Feedeorology, our web application takes the hassle out of deciding by providing a spoonful of recipe ideas for you to choose from! Not only that, but the choices are based on the weather of your current location to provide you the perfect dish for you, no matter the season.

The user has a choice in their experience they can start and end with just selecting their city and pressing go, OR the user can add any dietary needs they may have. Once a city has been selected, the user will be shown a list of weather appropriate food.

Technologies used:
Materialize
jQuery
OpenWeatherMap API, and Edemam API

Roles:
Stephen Clark : Project Manager and GitHub Master
Curtis Pazdar: Edemam API coordinator and javascript expert
Steve McNamara: OpenWeatherMap API coordinator and javascript expert
Wendy Tekverk: Front End designer

Challenges:
Merging conflicts
Getting both APIs to seamlessly work together

Successes:
Getting the Edemam API to use multiple search parameters within the Weather API
Seamlessly merging our final pushes.

DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:
While this application is deployed and usable, some further steps could be taken to improve it further.  
Increase user involvement with more chosen variables
Add more parameters to weather to get more specifications on types of food listed.
