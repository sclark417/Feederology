As full-stack developers, We wanted to create a website that let users choose ideas for meals depending on the weather.
The user will first start by entering the city they are in.
Then after they get the results of the weather in their current city, a list of pictures will pop up on meal ideas.
Once they click on the picture it will take them to a recipe they can choose.
We have made the website responsive to mobile platform as well
